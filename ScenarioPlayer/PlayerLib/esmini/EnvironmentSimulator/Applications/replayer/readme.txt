Application is launched from command line (or batch file). 

Usage : [options]
Options:
  --file <filename>
      Simulation recording data file
  --res_path <path>
      Path to resources root folder - relative or absolut
  --time_scale <factor>
      Playback speed scale factor (1.0 == normal)
  --start_time <ms>
      Start playing at timestamp
  --stop_time <ms>
      Stop playing at timestamp (set equal to time_start for single frame)
  --repeat
      loop scenario
  --road_features
      Show OpenDRIVE road features
  --view_mode <view_mode>
      Entity visualization: "model"(default)/"boundingbox"/"both"
  --no_ghost
      Remove ghost entities
  --remove_object <id>

    1 - 9: Camera models acording to :
        1: Custom camera model
        2: Flight
        3: Drive
        4: Terrain
        5: Orbit
        6: FirstPerson
        7: Spherical
        8: NodeTracker
        9: Trackball

    When custom camera model(1) is activated
        k: Switch between the following sub models:
           - Orbit(camera facing vehicle, rotating around it)
           - Fixed(fix rotation, always straight behind vehicle)
           - Flex(imagine the camera attached to vehicle via an elastic string)
           - Flex - orbit(Like flex but allows for roatation around vehicle)
           - Top(top view, fixed rotation, always straight above vehicle)

    Viewer options
        f: Toggle full screen mode
        t: Toggle textures
        s: Rendering statistics
        l: Toggle light
        w: Toggle geometry mode(shading, wireframe, dots)
        c: Save screenshot in JPEG format - in the folder where the application was started from
        h: Help

Mouse control

    Left:   Rotate
    Right:  Zoom
    Middle: Pan

    This is typical, exact behaviour depends on active camera model.

Recommended usage:
    Run esmini headless (fast without viewer) and produce a .dat file. Then launch replayer to view it. Example in Windows PowerShell, starting from esmini/bin folder:

    .\esmini --osc ..\resources\xosc\cut-in.xosc --record sim.dat --headless --fixed_timestep 0.01 ; .\replayer --file sim.dat --window 60 60 800 400 --res_path ..\resources --repeat
